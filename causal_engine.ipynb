    "# Hyperparameter Grid Search for Target-Trial Emulation\n",
    "\n",
    "This cell executes a systematic search across different propensity score trimming and weighting configurations to identify stable causal effects of daily nutritional exposures on next-night sleep architecture. The framework follows contemporary epidemiology guidelines to separate causal effects from confounding in large observational datasets by emulating a \"target trial\".\n",

    "### The Search Space\n",
    "\n",
    "The grid explores two primary mechanisms used in the study to ensure the internal validity of the causal estimates: \n",
    "1. **Quantile Trimming (QUANTILE_GRID):**\n",
    "   **Purpose:** To address extreme propensity scores that can lead to high variance or bias in treatment effect estimates. \n",
    "   **Mechanism:** It excludes treated observations with very low propensity scores and control observations with very high propensity scores to ensure \"common support\". \n",
    "2. **Weight Clipping (CLIPPING_GRID)**\n",
    "   **Purpose:** To further stabilize the Hájek-type estimator by reducing the influence of extreme weights. \n",
    "   **Mechanism:** Weights are clipped at specified upper and lower percentiles to reduce the influence of extreme values.\n",
    "   \n",
    "Following the paper's robustness protocols, a result for a specific exposure is considered reliable only if it meets these conditions within the grid search: \n",
    "- **Covariate Balance:** Reaches an Absolute Standardized Mean Difference (ASMD) of $\\le 0.10$ for general confounders. Strict Structural Balance: Reaches an ASMD of $\\le 0.05$ for key structural confounders (Age, Sex, BMI) and baseline sleep characteristics.\n",
    "- **Stability:** Average Treatment Effect (ATE) estimates must be stable across reasonable trimming and weighting configurations.\n",
    "- **Negative Controls:** Shows no evidence of systematic treatment effects on food-insensitive outcomes like heart-rate signal quality or sleep position.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Execution Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Exposure Selection:** Iterates through 25 prespecified dietary exposures covering diet quality, macronutrients, micronutrients, and meal timing.\n",
    "2. **Propensity Scoring:** Fits a CatBoost gradient-boosted tree classifier to estimate the probability of exposure based on a comprehensive set of baseline and time-varying covariates.\n",
    "3. **Experimentation:** Evaluates combinations of trimming (q) and clipping (clip) to find a configuration that satisfies the strict balance and validity thresholds required for causal interpretation."
